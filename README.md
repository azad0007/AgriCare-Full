Inspiration:-


1. NCRB data shows 42,480 farmers and daily wagers committed suicide in 2019.
2. High debt burdens, corruption in subsidies, crop failure, less awareness of government initiated schemes are the prime reasons for the suicides.
3. AgriCare is a system primarily consisting of a web and an android app which predicts the best crop for a particular geographical area considering various factors including climate, price in nearby market and soil properties using machine learning.

Implementation:-


[CROP PREDICTION] - 


1. Getting the location coordinates through the web and the android app and process it in the backend to fetch it into a machine learning model which considers various factors like climate, soil chemical composition, price in nearby market and predicts best crop at that particular geographical location through various dynamic data sets.
2. Using a centralized DB to draw out the conclusion for a particular crop considering the market supply chain factor and keeping track of all the crops in a particular geographical location.
3. We will be adding another model which will predict the price of the crop during its harvesting time and can use this data set while considering the best crop that can be grown there at a particular time.

[NEARBY WAREHOUSES]


1. Most of the farmers sell the crops at minimal cost with huge margin of loss all because nearby government warehouses refuse to accept that there is empty space in the warehouse and farmers are helpless to sell them in market at low price to the same people involved in warehouse scam.
2. “Nearby WareHouse” will give info about the nearby empty warehouses and all this will be managed with a centralized DB and an app for the government officials .
